    <h1>What is an ADIZ? (And Why Flying Into It Is Not an Invasion)</h1>

    <p class="lead">If you rely on mainstream news alerts, you might believe Taiwan's sovereign airspace is invaded on a weekly basis. In reality, the airspace remains untouched. The confusion stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what an Air Defence Identification Zone actually is.</p>

    <p>To accurately assess geopolitical risk, our intelligence team relies on precise legal and geographic definitions. The most commonly abused acronym in Indo Pacific reporting is "ADIZ." When media outlets conflate an ADIZ with sovereign airspace, they manufacture panic. Here is the operational difference, and why we track it the way we do.</p>

    <h2>Sovereign Airspace vs The Buffer Zone</h2>
    <p>International law, governed by the Chicago Convention, is very clear about where a country's actual airspace ends. Sovereign airspace extends exactly 12 nautical miles from a nation's coastline. If a foreign military aircraft breaches that 12 mile limit without permission, it is an illegal invasion and a direct act of war.</p>
    
    <p>An Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) is something entirely different.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>It is not international law:</strong> An ADIZ is a unilateral declaration. It has no backing in any international treaty.</li>
        <li><strong>It is over international waters:</strong> It acts as an early warning buffer zone extending hundreds of miles beyond sovereign territory.</li>
        <li><strong>The purpose:</strong> It gives a nation time to identify approaching aircraft and scramble interceptors if necessary, long before the 12 mile boundary is threatened.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>The Legacy of the Cold War</h2>
    <p>The concept of the ADIZ was invented by the United States in 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War. The goal was to prevent a surprise Soviet bomber attack. Today, over 20 countries operate their own zones, including Japan, South Korea, and China.</p>

    <p>Because these zones are unilaterally declared and not regulated by international bodies, they frequently overlap. In fact, Taiwan's ADIZ, which was established by the US military in the 1950s, geographically covers large portions of mainland China, including the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. This creates a bizarre technical reality: a People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jet taking off from a domestic runway in China is technically "entering" Taiwan's ADIZ the moment its wheels leave the ground.</p>

    <h2>Why the Media Gets It Wrong</h2>
    <p>When the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defence reports that 30 Chinese jets "entered our ADIZ," they are stating a factual, operational reality. The jets are operating in international airspace, but within Taiwan's designated early warning perimeter.</p>

    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding-left: 15px; margin: 30px 0; font-style: italic; color: #4b5563;">
        "When a headline screams that China has invaded Taiwanese airspace, they are almost exclusively referring to an ADIZ transit in international waters. A sovereign airspace breach has not occurred in decades."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Media algorithms favour high emotion and fear. "China Flies Planes in International Waters" does not generate clicks. "China Invades Airspace" does. This deliberate conflation artificially inflates the perceived risk of an immediate kinetic war.</p>

    <h2>The Buffer Zone in Action</h2>
    <p>To visualise exactly why these flights are categorised as monitoring exercises rather than kinetic threats, review this breakdown of Taiwan's airspace dynamics.</p>

    <h2>How Our Algorithm Processes an ADIZ Incursion</h2>
    <p>Our Risk Index is designed to filter out this specific type of media noise. Because ADIZ flights are a daily occurrence, they are baked into the baseline "Elevated" score of our tracker. They are treated as diplomatic signalling, not military strikes.</p>

    <p>We only escalate our risk metrics when ADIZ incursions are paired with severe market volatility in the semiconductor sector. If the planes cross the line, but the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) stock remains stable, we categorise the event as routine posturing. We wait for the smart money to move before we sound the alarm.</p>
