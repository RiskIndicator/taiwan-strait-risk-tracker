    <h1>Beyond TSMC: How a Taiwan Blockade Would Disrupt Apple and Nvidia</h1>

    <p class="lead">When military analysts model a Taiwan contingency, they often focus on amphibious assaults. Our intelligence team focuses on the math of a blockade.</p>

    <p>A kinetic war over Taiwan would erase an estimated $10.6 trillion from the global economy in its first year. However, a military blockade—without a single shot fired—would still wipe out 5.3% of global GDP. The primary casualties of this scenario are not just regional actors, but the titans of the American tech sector. We track the vulnerability of two companies specifically: Apple and Nvidia.</p>

    <h2>The Nvidia Bottleneck</h2>
    <p>Nvidia recently overtook Apple as TSMC's top customer. The current artificial intelligence boom relies entirely on Nvidia's GPUs, which consume massive silicon wafer areas. TSMC manufactures these advanced chips using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. </p>
    <p>If a Chinese naval blockade shuts down Taiwan's commercial ports for even 48 hours, the physical export of these chips stops. Cloud providers building billion-dollar AI data centers would face immediate hardware freezes. There is no backup factory in the US or Europe capable of absorbing this exact volume on short notice.</p>

    <h2>Apple's Supply Chain Cardiac Arrest</h2>
    <p>Apple's reliance on Taiwan is equally severe. Consider the data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple occupies roughly 90% of TSMC's 3nm production capacity.</li>
        <li>Apple has already secured over half of TSMC's upcoming 2nm capacity for 2026.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A blockade severs Apple from its core processors. The iPhone and Mac supply chains operate on tight, just-in-time logistics. A maritime disruption means assembly plants in China and India run out of logic boards within weeks, bringing global retail sales to a hard stop.</p>

    <h2>The Strait is the Artery</h2>
    <p>The media narrative often isolates the economic impact to TSMC alone. This is a mistake. Over 20% of global maritime trade—roughly $2.45 trillion worth of goods—transits the Taiwan Strait annually. A quarantine or blockade forces commercial shipping to reroute, creating immediate, punishing spikes in freight insurance and transit times.</p>

    <p>Our analysis indicates that financial markets consistently misprice this specific risk. This is why our Taiwan Strait Risk Index measures the divergence between TSMC and the S&P 500. When insiders detect a genuine blockade threat, TSMC will drop violently before the broader market reacts. Right now, the data tells us the risk is noise. But if the ports close, Apple and Nvidia will be the first dominoes to fall.</p>
